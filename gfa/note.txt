In the early 90s I was pre-computing in GFA Basic my tables used in the ASM source.

GFA Basic was a popular language on the Atari ST that was then ported to MS-DOS PC (GFA Basic 4.31).
It was a structured basic that could be interpreted or compiled, similar to MS Visual Basic, except
that GFA was already available on Atari in the end of the 80s.

archives on GFA are available at

The GFA files in this folder were used to generate precomputed information.  Not sure if they
correspond to the last release, but this is what I could find back on my 29 years old backup.
