Some assets I could find back on my old HDD drive backup.

LBM extension is for Deluxe Paint II IFF file format (256 colors), a popular painting software 
that existed on Amiga, MS-DOS PC and Atari ST.  In the 90s I was using the MS-DOS version.
I did some conversions in BMP format.

I've put also a playable version of Thomas Mogensen (Drax) "Crooner" Adlib music, in VGM and in D00.
You can play it with some dedicated chiptune players with VGM or AdPlug extensions, like XMPlay.

To convert the LBM pictures to includable data, I was using "alchemy" to convert pictures to raw
and then a GFA program to read the raw file and transform it to includable ASM ascii.

Recoil library allows to load these legacy picture formats that were popular in the 80s and early
90s.

The last asset in the intro is an ANSI logo edited with a program called "TheDraw"
